# Assignment 3: Functions and modules in python 

This repository contains solutions for **Module 4: Functions and modules in python**.  

## Tasks  

### Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:

- Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using recursion.
- Returns the calculated factorial.
- Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output. 

**Example Output:**  
- Factorial of 5 is: 120

### Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:

- Asks the user for a number as input.
- Uses the math module to calculate:
       - The square root of the number
       - The natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
       - The sine of the number (in radians)
- Displays all the calculated results.
- 
**Example Output:**  
- Enter a number: 25
- Square root: 5.0
- Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
- Sine: -0.13235175009777303
