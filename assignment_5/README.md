# Assignment 5: Data Structures and Strings in Python  

This repository contains solutions for **Module 6: Data Structures and Strings in Python.**.  

## Tasks  

### Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

Problem Statement:
- Write a Python program that:
                   - Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
                   - Asks the user to input a student's name.
                   - Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.
                   - If the studentâ€™s name is not found, displays an appropriate message.  

**Example Output(if student exist):**  
Enter the student's name: Hemlata
Hemlata's marks: 90
{'hemlata': 85, 'Arha': 95, 'Hemlata': '90'}
Enter the student's name: Arha
Arha's marks are: 95

**Example output(if student doesn't exist):**
Enter the student's name: Kiran
Kiran's marks: 88
{'hemlata': 85, 'Arha': 95, 'Kiran': '88'}
Enter the student's name: Meena
Student not found

### Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:

         -Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.

         - Extracts the first five elements from the list.

         - Reverses these extracted elements.

        - Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list.  

**Example Output:**  
Original list:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted first five elements:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted elements:  [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

## Concepts Covered
- Dictionary creation and key-value pairs
- Adding and retrieving dictionary elements
- Conditional statements with dictionary lookup
- List creation using loops
- List slicing and reversing using [::-1]
